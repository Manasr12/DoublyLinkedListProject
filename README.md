# Doubly Linked List (DLL) with Multilevel Nodes in Python

This repository introduces an advanced implementation of a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in Python.
## Features

### Node Operations
- Efficiently **add**, **find**, and **remove** nodes by their values, facilitating dynamic data management within the list.

### Multilevel Structure
- Nodes come with a `child` attribute, allowing them to point to another DLL. This feature enables the assembly of intricate, multilevel linked lists.

### Flattening
- The implementation offers a method to flatten multilevel lists into a single-level DLL. This process is carefully designed to preserve the original order of nodes, ensuring data integrity.

### Reversing
- A built-in function to reverse the DLL, allowing for the inversion of node order with minimal effort.

### Conversion
- Features to convert between standard Python lists and the DLL format are included, simplifying interactions with Python's built-in data structures.
